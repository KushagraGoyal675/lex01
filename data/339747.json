B's ship does not go to Bombay, but A has opportunities of procuring suitable conveyance for the cargo upon terms as advantageous as those on which he had chartered the ship.

The boat, owing to some avoidable cause, does not start at the time appointed, whereby the arrival of the cargo at Mirzapur is delayed beyond the time when it would have arrived if the boat had sailed according to the contract. After that date, and before the arrival of the cargo, the price of jute falls. The measure of the compensation payable to B by A is the difference between the price which B could have obtained for the cargo at Mirzapur at the time when it would have arrived if forwarded in due course, and its market price at the time when it actually arrived.</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-paragraph\" id=\"section_73.f\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/645058/\">(f)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">A contracts to repair B's house in a certain manner, and receives payment in advance.
